                                Dhuduki is a rustic instrument with a string. It is made of a medium sized wooden drum covered with iguana skin and a wooden bar in the middle of the drum tied with metal string. It is generally played with two fingers, commonly index finger and middle finger. The players adjust the string’s position by shifting the wooden bar and vibrating the string with their fingers, which as a result creates different types of tunes. But the tunes and the hypnotising music of Dhuduki are gradually fading away from people’s memory.

                                The violin, also known informally as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use.The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).

                                Gotipua is a traditional dance form of Odisha and the precursor of Odissi classical dance. It has been performed in Orissa for centuries by young boys, who dress as women to praise Jagannath and Krishna. The dance is executed by a group of boys who perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Radha and Krishna. The boys begin to learn the dance at an early age until adolescence, when their androgynous appearance changes. In the Odia language Gotipua, means "single boy" (goti-pua).

                                Mahari Dance is a ritualistic dance form Odisha and is nearly a millennium old with dance having been an integral part of the daily rituals at the Jagannath temple of Puri since the time of Ganga rulers of Utkal performed by devadasi dancers called maharis. The classical dance form of Odissi has its roots in the Mahari dance while the Gotipua dance originated as an offshoot of the Mahari tradition when it went into decline in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  Following the abolition of the devadasi system, the dance has been discontinued at the Jagannath Temple.

                                The mythological tale of the Ramayan is coming alive every day at the centuries old Sahi Jata festival in Puri. The unique folk street theatre, like every year, began on the occasion of Ram Navami on Friday. Following the ancient tradition, residents of each bylane or “sahi” of the city enact a particular episode from the epic. Every day, it is the turn of a particular bylane to present the religious form of folk theatre during the evenings. Foot-tapping music in the background and colourful periodic costumes along with dialogues make it a fascinating experience for viewers.
